## About
[sublimedice.com](https://sublimedice.com)

Based on, and an homage to PrimeDice, SublimeDice is a dice-rolling game. While simpler and more barebones than its predecessor, it is still yet equipped with features to implement a complete dice game:
* No actual gambling is occurring
    * SublimeDice uses a fictitious currency with no real-world monetary value
* Rolls are **provably fair**
    * Client seed can be changed for every game
    * Incrementing nonce tracks uses of each server seed
    * Players can rotate their seed pair at any time
    * Server seed is only revealed after rotating seed pair
* Personal profiles to track funds and bets
* Built-in house edge (1%)
* Automatic win-chance calculation and display
* Faucet for players to start anew after irrecoverable loss

## How to Play
[Check out the website's tutorial here](https://sublimedice.com/#tutorial).

Every account starts with Â¢500 Sublime Credits.

A player will set their wager: a prediction consisting of a numeric boundary and a direction. For example, "I predict the roll will be below 25." Alongside this, a player will provide the amount of credits they wish to wager.

When the game starts, a number between `0.00` and `99.99` (both inclusive) is rolled. If the rolled number is within the player's prediction, they win. The payout is a multiplier based on how "risky" their prediction was. If their win chance was ~50%, then their payout is 2x. However, if their win chance was only 25%, then their payout increases to 4x.

Players are welcome and encouraged to verify their bets. If you are unfamiliar with the **provably fair** algorithm, feel free to [read this short article](https://sublimedice.com/#fairness).
